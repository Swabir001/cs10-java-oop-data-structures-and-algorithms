# CS10 – Java Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains selected projects and assignments from a university-level
course focused on object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms
implemented in Java.

## Featured Projects
- Collaborative Sketch Editor – real-time multi-client drawing using sockets and threads
- Kevin Bacon Graph Search – graph modeling and shortest-path search
- Huffman Compression – lossless file compression using trees and priority queues
- Webcam Paint App – real-time color tracking and region growing
- Quadtree Collision Detection – spatial indexing for efficient 2D queries
- POS Tagging via HMM – Viterbi-based sequence modeling

## Topics Covered
- Object-oriented design (inheritance, interfaces, abstraction)
- Data structures (trees, graphs, maps, priority queues)
- Graph algorithms (BFS, shortest paths)
- Client-server systems and multithreading
- Interactive and graphical applications

Each project folder includes source code and documentation.
